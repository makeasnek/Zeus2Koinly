# Zeus2Koinly
This python script will help you convert your exported transactions from Zeus (CSV) into the format Koinly needs. Python 3 is required to run this. It will run on Windows, Linux, and OS X. 

# How to use:
1. Open your zeus wallet and swipe up to get to your transaction/activity list.
2. Select the download icon at the top right of your activity list. This will save the CSV file to your downloads folder on your phone.
3. Transfer the CSV file to your machine with python running on it. E-mail is probably the simplest way.
4. (optional, suggested) Prep files - Place files with the names `invoices.csv` `payments.csv` and `onchain.csv` into the same directory as this script. If you don't do this, the script will prompt you for absolute paths, (in Windows, right click on CSV file and select properties to find this)
5. Run the script with `python main.py` (see platform-specific instructions below)
6. output.csv will be created, which you can import into Koinly
7. Make a donation if this script has been useful (see below for more information)


<h4>Windows</h4>

 - Download the latest version of python from python.org. Enable the "install to system path" option while installing.
 - Double-click main.py or in command prompt, run `python C:\users\username\Downloads\Zeus2Koinly\main.py` or wherever you saved the tool. I suggest the command prompt method as it will display errors if there are any.

<h4>Linux</h4>

 - Open a terminal and go to the folder you downloaded this tool into using `cd '/home/user/Downloads/Zeus2Koinly'` or wherever you put it
 - Run `python3 main.py` in the terminal

<h4>OS X</h4>

 - Open a terminal and go to the folder you downloaded this tool into using `cd '/home/user/Downloads/Zeus2Koinly'` or wherever you put it
 - Run `python3 main.py`
